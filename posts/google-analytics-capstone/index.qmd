Hello and welcome to my first blog post on Quarto! As a part of my Google Data Analytics specialization course capstone project, I have created this blog. In this post, I will be exploring the changes in historical exports of Lithuania over time, using the 6-step framework presented in the course. I hope you enjoy reading about my findings and analysis. Let's begin!

## Ask

Before diving into data processing and visualization, it's essential to take note of the following key events: the Covid-19 pandemic since spring 2020, the strained relationship between China and Lithuania due to the Taiwan question, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the global economy, and Lithuania was no exception. The outbreak caused major disruptions in global trade, resulting in a decline in demand for Lithuanian goods and services. On the other hand, Lithuania's relationship with China has been deteriorating due to the Taiwan question. This has led to a decrease in exports to China, one of Lithuania's top trading partners.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has also had a significant impact on Lithuania's trade patterns. The conflict has resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, affecting Lithuania's trade with its Eastern neighbor. The situation is still developing, and it will be interesting to see how Lithuania's trade with Russia evolves in the coming years.

## Prepare

The data was downloaded from the Lithuanian National [website](https://www.lb.lt/en/export-and-import-of-services-by-country) in an Excel file format. You can also find the same file in my blog's Github [repo](https://github.com/TK-Problem/personal-website/tree/main/posts/google-analytics-capstone). It was then loaded into R environment using the `tidyverse` library and processed converted to `data.table` format.

```{r}
#| warning: false
# load libraries
library(readxl)
library(data.table)

# read data from excel
dt <- read_excel("lb_data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A13:AN201")

# convert to data.table object
dt <- data.table(dt)

# rename columns for convinience
setnames(dt, c("...1"), "Type")

# shift columns to get correct names
dt[, Country := rep(dt[seq(1, nrow(dt), 4), Type], each = 4)]
dt <- dt[!(seq(1, nrow(dt), 4))]

# generate table with first few rows and columns
knitr::kable(dt[1:6, c(41, 1, 38, 39, 40)])
```

In the table above, you can see the total exports and imports of all countries, as well as those of the European Union's (27 countries) for the three most recent quarters. Even before data cleaning and preparation, a visual analysis shows that a majority of exports and imports go to EU countries.

## Process

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
