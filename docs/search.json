In this post, I will be exploring the changes in historical exports of Lithuania over time, using the 6-step framework presented in the course. I hope you enjoy reading about my findings and analysis. Let’s begin!"

    "text": "Ask\nBefore diving into data processing and visualization, it’s essential to take note of the following key events: the Covid-19 pandemic since spring 2020, the strained relationship between China and Lithuania due to the Taiwan question, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the global economy, and Lithuania was no exception. The outbreak caused major disruptions in global trade, resulting in a decline in demand for Lithuanian goods and services. On the other hand, Lithuania’s relationship with China has been deteriorating due to the Taiwan question. This has led to a decrease in exports to China, one of Lithuania’s top trading partners.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has also had a significant impact on Lithuania’s trade patterns. The conflict has resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, affecting Lithuania’s trade with its Eastern neighbor. The situation is still developing, and it will be interesting to see how Lithuania’s trade with Russia evolves in the coming years."
