The outbreak caused major disruptions in global trade, resulting in a decline in demand for Lithuanian goods and services. On the other hand, Lithuania’s relationship with China has been deteriorating due to the Taiwan question. This has led to a decrease in exports to China, one of Lithuania’s top trading partners.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has also had a significant impact on Lithuania’s trade patterns. The conflict has resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, affecting Lithuania’s trade with its Eastern neighbor. The situation is still developing, and it will be interesting to see how Lithuania’s trade with Russia evolves in the coming years."

This means that the EU is becoming more reliant on imports and is potentially exporting less to other countries.\nWhen it comes to trade with Russia, both imports and exports have been declining steadily even before the start of the 2022 war. Prior to the war, Lithuania was a net importer with Russian trade. Surprisingly, tensions between China and Lithuania did not have a significant impact on their trade relationship, and the share of total imports from China increased almost 5 times.\nFinally let’s analyze how imports and exports were affected with Countries close to Russia.\n\n\nCode\n# countries to select\ncountry.list <- c(\"Kazakhstan\", \"Belarus\", \"Russia\", \"Turkey\", \"Offshore financial centers\")\n\n# select data for plotting\ndt.plot.3 <- copy(dt.plot.1[Country %in% country.list])\n\n# reshape table\ndt.plot.3 <- dcast(dt.plot.3, Quarter+Type~Country, value.var = \"value\")\n\n# reshape back\ndt.plot.3 <- melt(dt.plot.3, id.vars = c(\"Quarter\", \"Type\"), variable.name = \"Country\")\n\n# create new label\ndt.plot.3[, label := paste(Country, Type)]\n\n# color dictionary\ncolor.dict <- c(\"#C5AFA4\", \"#CC7E85\", \"#CF4D6F\", \"#A36D90\", \"#76818E\")\n\n# left figure\nfig1 <- plot_ly(data = dt.plot.3[Type == \"Imports\"],\n                x = ~Quarter, y = ~value, color=~label, colors = color.dict,\n                type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers',\n                marker = list(line = list(width = 3)))\n\n# right figure\nfig2 <- plot_ly(data = dt.plot.3[Type == \"Exports\"],\n                x = ~Quarter, y = ~value, color=~label,\n                colors = color.dict,\n                type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers',\n                line = list(dash = 'dot'),\n                marker = list(line = list(width = 3)))\n\nfig <- subplot(fig1, fig2, nrows = 2) %>% \n  layout(title = 'Exports and imports with countries close to Russia')\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s turn our attention to how trade with countries close to Russia has been affected. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imports and exports with Turkey and Kazakhstan have increased 3-5 times. This increase may be attributed to companies trying to circumvent sanctions to Russia through exports to Kazakhstan. It’s interesting to see how companies are adapting to changes in trade relationships and finding new opportunities to continue doing business."

Based on the findings, several conclusions can be drawn:\n\nFirstly, the declines in imports and exports with Russia preceded the 2022 invasion to Ukraine. This finding suggests that the declining trade relationship between the two countries started since 2014 Crimea annexation.\nSecondly, the analysis revealed that political tensions over Taiwan did not have a substantial impact on exports to China.\nFinally, the data indicates that imports and exports to Kazakhstan have increased, potentially due to sanctions against Russia. This finding underscores the importance of considering the geopolitical context when imposing economical sanctions.\n\nOverall, the present study highlights the complexities of trade relationships between Lithuania and other countries."
