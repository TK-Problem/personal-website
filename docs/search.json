The outbreak caused major disruptions in global trade, resulting in a decline in demand for Lithuanian goods and services. On the other hand, Lithuania’s relationship with China has been deteriorating due to the Taiwan question. This has led to a decrease in exports to China, one of Lithuania’s top trading partners.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has also had a significant impact on Lithuania’s trade patterns. The conflict has resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions on Russia, affecting Lithuania’s trade with its Eastern neighbor. The situation is still developing, and it will be interesting to see how Lithuania’s trade with Russia evolves in the coming years."

Furthermore, I noticed that the largest export changes were seen in countries with relatively small exports in 2003 Q3, such as Croatia and Malta, whose exports increased 40 times. It’s worth noting that Canada, a large economy, also saw a significant increase in exports, which grew almost 30 times.\n\n\nCode\n# get top 10 starting and last period countries by export\ntop_change <- tail(dt.export[, c(41, 4, 40, 42)][order(`Change, %`)], 5)\nlow_change <- head(dt.export[, c(41, 4, 40, 42)][order(`Change, %`)], 5)\n\n# get changes\ndt.changes <- rbind(low_change, top_change)\n\n# generate kable table\nkbl(dt.changes, caption = \"Top 5 largest positive and negative export changes\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"))\n\n\n\n\nTop 5 largest positive and negative export changes\n \n  \n    Country \n    Q3/2013 \n    Q3/2022 \n    Change, % \n  \n \n\n  \n    Egypt \n    4.65 \n    0.94 \n    -79.8 \n  \n  \n    Belarus \n    120.38 \n    45.89 \n    -61.9 \n  \n  \n    Russia \n    323.90 \n    154.09 \n    -52.4 \n  \n  \n    Japan \n    1.64 \n    1.21 \n    -26.2 \n  \n  \n    India \n    2.52 \n    3.03 \n    20.2 \n  \n  \n    Bulgaria \n    0.76 \n    13.92 \n    1731.6 \n  \n  \n    Canada \n    0.38 \n    11.62 \n    2957.9 \n  \n  \n    Romania \n    0.70 \n    27.03 \n    3761.4 \n  \n  \n    Malta \n    0.50 \n    21.17 \n    4134.0 \n  \n  \n    Croatia \n    0.11 \n    5.39 \n    4800.0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding imports, I observed that imports were reduced to only three countries: Finland, Belarus, and Russia.
